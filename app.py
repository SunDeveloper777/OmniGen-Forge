OmniGen is a unified image generation model that you can use to perform various tasks, including but not limited to text-to-image generation, subject-driven generation, Identity-Preserving Generation, and image-conditioned generation.

For multi-modal to image generation, you should pass a string as `prompt`, and a list of image paths as `input_images`. The placeholder in the prompt should be in the format of `<img><|image_*|></img>`.
For example, use a image of a woman to generate a new image:
prompt = "A woman holds a bouquet of flowers and faces the camera. Thw woman is \<img\>\<|image_1|\>\</img\>."
